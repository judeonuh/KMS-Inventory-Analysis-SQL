# KMS-Inventory-Analysis  
Kultra Mega Stores (KMS), headquartered in Lagos, specialises in office supplies and furniture. Its customer base includes individual consumers, small businesses (retail), and large corporate clients (wholesale) across Lagos, Nigeria. Analysis of 4 years of order data revealed that high and critical orders were frequently shipped via slow delivery trucks, while low-priority orders used Express Air. This systematic mismatch is estimated to be driving avoidable costs and customer dissatisfaction.

## Aim
My task as a Business Intelligence Analyst was to support the Abuja division of KMS by analysing the [Excel data file](https://github.com/judeonuh/KMS-Inventory-Analysis/blob/main/KMS%20Sql%20Case%20Study.csv) (containing order data from 2009 to 2012) provided by the Business Manager, using SQL.
